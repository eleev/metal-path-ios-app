iOS application sandbox that holds various Metal API related scenes, from very fundamental to advanced developments ðŸ¤–. The motivation behind the project is the following :

- Create a learning framework that allows to quickly prototype and experiment with `Metal API`.
- Dive deeper into `GPU` programming, which both involves `compute` and `rendering` sides. 
- Use the developments to reference them and potentially use some technical or conceptual sketches.
